# DESCRIPTION

In this task, I designed a creative product UI for a fictional fruit beer brand called Fruite. The design includes three flavor variants â€“ Apple, Strawberry, and Lemon  each with its own unique color palette and matching fruit visuals.The main highlight of the UI is the beer can in the center, showcasing the flavor label and product identity.I made use of bold typography to emphasize the fruit name and bring attention to the product.Each variant includes matching background colors and fruit illustrations to strengthen brand identity.To make the can more visually appealing, I added a shine effect using Figma techniques like gradients, blur, and layering.
The shine adds a realistic touch and gives the can a glossy, polished look, making it stand out.
